    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      Decision bias is a cognitive bias that occurs when people make decisions based on factors that are not relevant to the decision at hand. This can lead people to make choices that are not in their best interest, or that go against their own beliefs and values. Some common types of decision bias include confirmation bias, the sunk cost fallacy, and the framing effect. Decision bias can influence people in many different situations, from everyday decision-making to more significant life choices.

      The gamblers fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, is a type of cognitive bias that occurs when individuals believe that a random event is more or less likely to happen based on past events. For example, if a coin has come up heads several times in a row, a person with the gamblers fallacy may believe that it is now more likely to come up tails. In reality, the probability of a coin coming up heads or tails is always 50/50, regardless of what has happened in the past. This type of bias can lead people to make irrational decisions, such as continuing to play a game of chance even when the odds are not in their favor. The gamblers fallacy is named after the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, where it was observed in action by the mathematician Ã‰mile Borel in 1913.

    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      Anchoring and adjustment bias is a type of cognitive bias that occurs when individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information they receive when making a decision, and fail to adequately adjust their beliefs or judgments based on new information. This can lead people to make decisions that are based on flawed or incomplete information, and can result in poor decision-making. Anchoring and adjustment bias is a common form of decision bias, and can have a significant impact on both personal and professional decision-making. It is important for individuals to be aware of this bias and to actively seek out additional information when making decisions, in order to avoid making decisions that are based on incomplete or incorrect information.
