    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Introduction</p>
    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      Decision bias is a cognitive bias that occurs when people make decisions based on factors that are not relevant to the decision at hand. This can lead people to make choices that are not in their best interest, or that go against their own beliefs and values. Some common types of decision bias include confirmation bias, the sunk cost fallacy, and the framing effect. Decision bias can influence people in many different situations, from everyday decision-making to more significant life choices.

    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      As my group and I work together to progress our ISP project, we will have to make many decisions along the way, and it is very likely that many of these decisions will be affected by various decision biases. The biases that I believe are most likely to impact our project include chance bias, anchoring and adjustment bias, confirmation bias, complexity bias, and habit bias. 
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Complexity Bias</p>
    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      Complexity bias is the tendency for individuals to be influenced by feelings of stress or anxiety when making decisions, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including time pressure, uncertainty, and the potential consequences of making the wrong decision. It is important to manage your stress levels when making important decisions. If our group procrastinates, and doesn't do enough work on our ISP until it is very late, then we will have a lot more stress when trying to complete it because of the upcoming deadline, which could cause us to make uninformed decisions. We can avoid this by making sure to follow the plan we set out in our Gantt chart, which will help us keep track of our progress and avoid putting off the work until it is too late.     
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Impact Bias</p>
    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      Impact bias is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency for people to overestimate the lasting impact of events or experiences on their emotions. This can lead people to believe that they will feel much more intensely about an event or experience than they actually do. For example, a group member could be nervous to present an idea, because they might overestimate how others will react to it (Blackett, 2017). In my personal experience, I have sometimes not said ideas during a group project because I overestimated how others would feel about my idea being bad. In reality, it is better to give out both bad and good ideas rather than being scared of what others will think and not giving any ideas. I have mostly got over this fear, but we can help prevent this for everyone by making all our group members feel included, and to always consider people's ideas without dismissing them too quickly, so that everyone is comfortable throwing out as many ideas as possible, which can help us come to the best solution to the problems that arise during our ISP project. 
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Anchoring and Adjustment Bias</p>
    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      Anchoring and adjustment bias is a type of cognitive bias that occurs when individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information they receive when making a decision, and fail to adequately adjust their beliefs or judgments based on new information. This also affects relationships between people, because it is hard to change the first impression that one person has for another. This can lead to people making flawed decisions if the first impression is not representative of how the person really is. It is important for individuals to keep this bias in mind, and make sure to consider new experiences with the same weight as past experiences, which were the first source of information or first impression. If one of our group members has a bad first impression of another, it could cause them to not listen to their input and ideas, which could make us miss out on potentially good ideas.    
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Habit Bias</p>
    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      Habit bias is a type of cognitive bias that occurs when individuals make decisions based on their past experiences and established habits, rather than considering new information or alternative options. This can lead people to make decisions that are not in their best interests, or that are based on outdated or irrelevant information. We can try to prevent habit bias by being more open-minded. Being open-minded means being willing to consider new ideas and information, even if they contradict your pre-existing beliefs or habits. Individuals who are not open-minded may be more susceptible to habit bias, as they may be less likely to consider alternative options or to seek out new information (Freemire, 2007). It is important to actively seek out new information and perspectives when making decisions, in order to avoid being influenced by habit bias and to make the best possible choices.    
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Confirmation Bias</p>
    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      Confirmation bias is a type of cognitive bias that occurs when individuals seek out information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs, and ignore or discount information that contradicts those beliefs (Arnott, 2017). For example, in our ISP, we could mistakenly believe that our AI model is performing really well, and unintentionally discount the times when the AI doesn't work properly, which could cause us to decide not to try further improving the AI, because we might only remember that times that the AI works properly and confirms our beliefs that it is doing really well. The best way to help prevent this bias is to be more aware of the bias and actively remember information that challenges their beliefs, in order to avoid making decisions that are based on flawed or incorrect information.    
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Conclusion</p>
    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      It is important for us to be able to adjust our thinking processes to reduce our susceptibility to biases like these, to make sure that the decisions we make will result in the best possible outcome for our project.
