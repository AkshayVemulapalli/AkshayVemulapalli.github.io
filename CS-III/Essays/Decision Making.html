    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      Decision bias is a cognitive bias that occurs when people make decisions based on factors that are not relevant to the decision at hand. This can lead people to make choices that are not in their best interest, or that go against their own beliefs and values. Some common types of decision bias include confirmation bias, the sunk cost fallacy, and the framing effect. Decision bias can influence people in many different situations, from everyday decision-making to more significant life choices.

      As my group and I work together to progress our ISP project, we will have to make many decisions along the way, and it is very likely that many of these decisions will be affected by various decision biases. The biases that I believe are most likely to impact our project include chance bias, anchoring and adjustment bias, confirmation bias, complexity bias, and habit bias. 
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Chance Bias</p>
    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      The gamblers fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, is a type of cognitive bias that occurs when individuals believe that a random event is more or less likely to happen based on past events. For example, if a coin has come up heads several times in a row, a person with the gamblers fallacy may believe that it is now more likely to come up tails. In reality, the probability of a coin coming up heads or tails is always 50/50, regardless of what has happened in the past. This type of bias can lead people to make irrational decisions, such as continuing to play a game of chance even when the odds are not in their favor. The gamblers fallacy is named after the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, where it was observed in action by the mathematician Ã‰mile Borel in 1913.

    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Anchoring and Adjustment Bias</p>
    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      Anchoring and adjustment bias is a type of cognitive bias that occurs when individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information they receive when making a decision, and fail to adequately adjust their beliefs or judgments based on new information. This can lead people to make decisions that are based on flawed or incomplete information, and can result in poor decision-making. Anchoring and adjustment bias is a common form of decision bias, and can have a significant impact on both personal and professional decision-making. It is important for individuals to be aware of this bias and to actively seek out additional information when making decisions, in order to avoid making decisions that are based on incomplete or incorrect information.    
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Confirmation Bias</p>
    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      Confirmation bias is a type of cognitive bias that occurs when individuals seek out information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs, and ignore or discount information that contradicts those beliefs. This can lead people to make decisions that are based on flawed or incomplete information, and can result in poor decision-making. Confirmation bias is a common form of decision bias, and can have a significant impact on both personal and professional decision-making. It is important for individuals to be aware of this bias and to actively seek out information that challenges their beliefs, in order to avoid making decisions that are based on flawed or incorrect information.    
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Complexity Bias</p>
    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      A bias towards stress in decision-making is the tendency for individuals to be influenced by feelings of stress or anxiety when making decisions. This can lead individuals to make decisions that are not in their best interests, or that are based on flawed logic or faulty assumptions. A bias towards stress in decision-making can be caused by a variety of factors, including time pressure, uncertainty, and the potential consequences of making the wrong decision. This type of bias can have a significant impact on both personal and professional decision-making, and can lead individuals to make decisions that they later regret. It is important for individuals to be aware of this bias and to take steps to manage their stress levels when making important decisions. This can include taking time to carefully consider all of the available options, seeking out additional information or advice, and avoiding making decisions when they are feeling overwhelmed or anxious.    
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Habit Bias</p>
    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      Habit bias is a type of cognitive bias that occurs when individuals make decisions based on their past experiences and established habits, rather than considering new information or alternative options. This can lead people to make decisions that are not in their best interests, or that are based on outdated or irrelevant information. Habit bias can affect individuals and groups, and can have a significant impact on the decisions that are made in both personal and professional contexts.
      <br>
      Being open-minded means being willing to consider new ideas and information, even if they contradict your pre-existing beliefs or habits. Individuals who are not open-minded may be more susceptible to habit bias, as they may be less likely to consider alternative options or to seek out new information. This can result in poor decision-making, and can prevent individuals from making the most informed and effective choices. It is important for individuals to be open-minded and to actively seek out new information and perspectives when making decisions, in order to avoid being influenced by habit bias and to make the best possible choices.    
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Conclusion</p>
    <p class="essay cg lh2">
      It is important for us to be able to adjust our thinking processes to reduce our susceptibility to biases like these, to make sure that the decisions we make will result in the best possible outcome for our project.
