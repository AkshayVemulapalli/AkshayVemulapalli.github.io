      Project: Detect and Deter Drowsiness Inator (AKA Dx3) <br>
      <a class ="clg" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FjcwtRR97NN9gxl0EhvdcipkYsJArrFQ05S4d37Ilm8/edit#gid=0">Gantt Chart Link</a>
    </p>
    <h2 class="cs tcenter mono">Problem</h2>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      Currently, one of the greatest problems within humanity is staying awake. A study executed by the AAA Foundation estimated that 100,000 police-reported, drowsy-driving crashes result in about 800 deaths and about 50,000 injuries each year. Drowsy driving affects everyone and greatly impairs both motor control as well as reaction speeds. Furthermore, students in the modern day often fall asleep in lectures and miss out on important information.
    </p>
    <h2 class="cs tcenter mono">Solution</h2>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      Dx3 will aid in keeping its user awake during important activities and in times of need. Firstly, Dx3 works by tracking the user's fave and facial expressions. By tracking the user's eyes, Dx3 can determine how long the user's eyes have been closed. If the user's eyes are closed for an extended period of time, Dx3 will detect that the user has become drowsy and is falling asleep. Then, Dx3 will activate to help awaken the user with a user-chosen deterrent. Deterrents range from music, sirens, a small vibration, or a small electric shock. Once Dx3 determines that the user is sufficiently awake, it will return to a stand-by mode.
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      If the user is repeatedly falling asleep, Dx3 will prompt its user to brew a cup of coffee. If the user accepts through either voice command, button, or mobile app, Dx3 will produce said coffee in a linked device.
    </p>
    <h2 class="cs tcenter mono">Target Market</h2>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      Students - A student doing homework late at night or struggling to remain awake during class would make great use of Dx3.
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      Teacher - Teachers could easily use Dx3 to keep their students productive and awake.
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      Truckers - Driving long distances can be a tired, monotonous task, so this product would help users by helping them push through the long nights.
    </p>
    <h2 class="cs tcenter mono">Competition</h2>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      Apps such as Awake, Stay Awake, and Driver alarm are products that serve a very similar purpose except they are more focused on drowsy driving. But the drawbacks to there products are some don’t even use facial recognition, much of there software is outdated and buggy, and the apps don’t over a good enough stimulant or incentive to stay awake.
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      Dx3 will be different from our competitors because not only will we make a physical/auditory stimulant to keep our users awake, we will also provide incentives and helpful tips on what to do to prevent drowsiness. Many apps with smiliar premises only scratch the surface, while DDD will hit the ground running.
    </p>
    <h2 class="cs tcenter mono">Revenue Streams</h2>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      Dx3 will sell directly to customers from an online page and/or amazon page. Our online page will contain information about our product, a place for customer feedback, and an FAQ, along with much more information. To have a successful launch, a marketing campaign or general ad promotion would help make our product more successful.
    </p>
    <h2 class="cs tcenter mono">Marketing Activites</h2>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      Recently trends have showed that in website video stream ads preform worse than static ads that appears on the border of websites. To utilize google ads we must create a visually appealing add that isn’t too flashy but persuasive enough to increase click rate.
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      TikTok ads - After assessing the marketing and ads that go into tiktok, the most profitable method would be through sponsoring and authenticity while also making an account that has an influential platform. Products tend to do better when a consumer can not only be fond of the product, but also the company behind it.
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      Instagram ads - People love to support student led projects and business and like to be updated on what is happening with them currently. Instagram could provide as the medium for that as we can document the creative process also give a behind the scenes detail about the group and the project. This builds a more committed consumer base and tends to gain attraction with others taking inspiration from a successful group.
