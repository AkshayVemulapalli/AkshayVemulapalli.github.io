      In our efforts to build a robust image recognition system specifically tailored for facial recognition, we have initiated the development of a machine learning model and conducted research to determine the most appropriate approach. After considering various options such as K-Nearest Neighbor models, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks, I realized that it may be necessary to evaluate the performance of each model to arrive at a conclusion. However, we encountered some challenges while uploading facial images into our database, and we are currently working to resolve these issues.

      As we embark on this exciting project, we have already begun laying the groundwork for its technical implementation. While we are fortunate to not have encountered any significant technical obstacles thus far, we have determined that the creation of two databases will be among the first steps in our technical journey. The first database will store face images, while the second will have crucial information about attendance, including past records. We anticipate that the creation of these databases will present numerous technical challenges along the way. However, by anticipating and addressing these challenges proactively, we are confident that we will be able to overcome them and deliver a robust and effective solution.

    </p>
    <h3 class="csv mono tcenter bold">Roles</h3>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>(Software) Development Engineer</p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      Software Development Engineers design and write code for software. Some types of projects they work on include network systems, operating systems, databases, and apps for desktop or mobile devices. Softwares engineers are often well versed in programming languages like C++, Java, and Python. 
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      Software engineers benefit from being detail-oriented, having strong analytical and problem-solving skills, and being able to work well with others. I would be a great fit for this role because I have a lot of experience coding, especially in AI, which is what our project is centered around, and I have good problem solving and analytical skills.
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      A software engineer may encounter many challenges throughout their career. One common challenge is debugging code that is not working as intended. To solve this challenge, I could use various debugging tools such as print statements or a debugger to identify the source of the error. Another challenge is performance issues in code. To solve this, I could profile the code to identify bottlenecks and optimize them for better performance.
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>QA Engineer</p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      A quality assurance engineer, sometimes referred to as a QA engineer, is in charge of testing and confirming that software is high-quality and complies with all criteria. To make sure that software is functionally sound and satisfies user requirements, QA engineers often create and carry out test plans, cases, and scripts. Additionally, QA engineers may be in charge of monitoring and reporting defects, working with development teams to find and fix problems, and taking part in process improvement projects. 
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      In order to be effective in their role, QA engineers should have strong attention to detail, excellent problem-solving skills, and the ability to work well in a team. I would be a good fit for a QA engineer because I would be thorough when searching for bugs and be able to communicate well with developers so they could fix the bugs.
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      A challenge a QA engineer may face is finding defects that are difficult to reproduce. To solve this, I could try to recreate the steps that led to the defect and gather more information about the environment and circumstances. A QA engineer may also encounter challenges such as incomplete or unclear requirements, which can make it difficult to create effective test cases, which can be solved by more communication with the developers. 
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Project Manager</p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      A project manager manages the successful delivery of a specific project within a defined timeline and budget. They are responsible for developing project plans, coordinating with team members and stakeholders, and monitoring progress to ensure that projects stay on track. They may also be responsible for tracking and reporting on project metrics, managing budgets and resources, and handling risks and issues as they arise.
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      A good project manager should have strong leadership, communication, and organizational skills, as well as the ability to manage and motivate a team. I would be a good fit for a project manager, because I have experience with leadership roles in clubs and organizations, and I have the organizational skills to plan things out and account for mishaps.
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      A project manager may encounter challenges such as the project goals changing from the original plan. To solve this challenge, I could clearly communicate the project scope to the team, so that the original plans are less likely to change, but I should still be able to adapt and reschedule plans to changing ideas.
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Product Manager</p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      A product manager is responsible for defining and prioritizing the features of the product, gathering and analyzing customer feedback, and setting and tracking key performance indicators for the product. They also must analyze the market and have an understanding of the key metrics that relate to the product’s success. They must ensure cross-functionality between teams working on different parts of the product.
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      A good product manager should be able to understand and communicate the technical aspects of the product, have a strong understanding of the market and customers, and be able to lead teams to deliver successful products. I think I would be a great fit for a product manager, because I understand what features our product needs, and how to prioritize the features to create early prototypes as well as strong further development..
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      A challenge a product manager may face is making feature-based decisions in the face of uncertainty. To solve this, I could gather and analyze data from user feedback and performance metrics, and use this information to inform the decision-making process, and determine which features are most important to prioritize first.
    </p>
    <p class="essay w lh2 bold"><br>Release Engineer</p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      A release engineer is a software engineering professional who is responsible for the release and deployment of software products. Release engineers work closely with developers and testers to ensure that software is released on time, with high quality, and with minimal downtime or disruptions.
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      Release engineers need to be very detail-oriented, to make sure every detail is working well during the release of the software, and be able to communicate well with other team members to make sure that the product is getting released on time and in good condition. I would be a pretty good fit for a release engineer because I have learned to pay attention to small details, and I have developed strong communication skills through clubs like debate.
    </p>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      A challenge a release engineer may face is dealing with last-minute changes or issues that arise during the release process. To solve this, I must have a contingency plan in place and be prepared to quickly change to meet new needs and ensure that the release is still successful.
