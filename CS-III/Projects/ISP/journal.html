      A quality assurance engineer, sometimes referred to as a QA engineer, is in charge of testing and confirming that software is high-quality and complies with all criteria. To make sure that software is functionally sound and satisfies user requirements, QA engineers often create and carry out test plans, cases, and scripts. Additionally, QA engineers may be in charge of monitoring and reporting defects, working with development teams to find and fix problems, and taking part in process improvement projects.
