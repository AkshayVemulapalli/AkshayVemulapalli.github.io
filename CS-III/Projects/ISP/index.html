    <h2 class="cs tcenter mono">Auto Attendance</h2>
    <p class = "essay clg mono">
      In most schools today, attendance is a tedious process that takes a few minutes of each class every day, which adds up to lots of hours overtime. Also, it is hard to manually fix errors in attendance recording, as students have to go to attendance offices to make changes in the system. Having a system for automated attendance could solve many of these problems and provide even more benefits. Our group hopes to make a camera that automatically takes attendance for each student as they enter the classroom. The results would automatically be entered into a database, which would be sent to school administrators. The system would also record the time students enter, automatically recording tardies so teachers wouldnâ€™t have to enter in absences at first. This program could also be used outside of schools for companies to record when employees are present automatically.
