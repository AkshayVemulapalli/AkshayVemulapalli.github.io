      In classrooms around the world, countless hours are wasted taking attendance. For this reason, my group and I have developed a solution: automated attendance. Essentially, our goal is to create a software that utilizes facial reconition software to compare a captured face with ones in a database to automatically complete attendance. A camera would be placed at the entrance of a room to find faces and capture them to then be utilized for attendance. Then, the results would be shared directly with the school, removing any actions needed by a teacher. Currently, taking attendance is a time consuming process often riddled with errors, so our product would be designed to both save time as well as minimalize possible human errors. Outside of a school setting, our program could also be used to clock workers in and out of jobs, creating an accurate representation of how many hours a worker was actually present. The only requirement for the users of this application is a database of the faces who need to be accoounted for.
