    <h1 class="cpv1 tcenter mono">Why is my digital portfolio important to me?</h1>
    <p class='cg mid50 tcenter mono'>The digital portfolio is an important place for me to present my experiences and achievements in Computer Science. By sharing the activities, projects, and achievements that I've done in the past will allow me to demonstrate my success, work ethic, and creativity.</p>
    <p class='cg mid50 tcenter mono'></br>This portfolio will be useful for colleges, internships, and employers. It will stand out above those who have just a normal resume, because it will display my past experiences in a more readable and artistic way. Digital portfolios are also easier to share because they can be accessed by others with just one link.</p>
    <p class='cg mid50 tcenter mono'></br>In the process of making the digital portfolio, I'll be able to reflect on my past experiences and see how my skills have improved and evolved over time. Reflecting is important, because it promotes learning and personal development. Making this digital portfolio will also give me more experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
